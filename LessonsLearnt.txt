This is a collection of short lessions learnt and docs for the prime numbers project.

- Extensibility means a lot more code for simple programs.

- Web IO is different from Terminal IO: Huge if/switch-case blocks are needed to seperate the two.

- There are no real obect dependencies required to find prime numbers, it is a very atomic task.

- the number one is an edge case (not prime).

- If the method doesn't diverge from the expected output for the first hundred results we can show a statistically significant proabalility that it is accurate for any given N.
- The source of primes used can be found at: https://primes.utm.edu/lists/small/1000.txt

- Computers aren't perfect Math machines and seem to break with numbers more than 8 bytes long: The remainder on Modulo division "wraps" around.
--Corollary; If we were to try and find more than the first 1.84 x 10^19 prime numbers (8 bytes) we would either use CUDA or pass the task down to our children.

- To complete every facet of this task to demostration standard would take much longer than the available time, thus only the core class PrimeFinder is going to be added to mainline.
